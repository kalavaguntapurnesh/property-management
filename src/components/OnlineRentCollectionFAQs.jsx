                title="What type of payments can I collect using Avail?"
                answer="You can collect credit card payments, debit card payments, and ACH payments â€” whichever your tenant chooses to pay rent with."

              <Accordion
                title="How do I accept ACH payments for a rental property?"
                answer="After setting up your rental property and choosing your subscription, click the Payments tab to enter your tenant's email address. We will then email them instructions on how to set up ACH payments, CreditBoost, and Autopay. You can then receive ACH payments from tenants once they've set up their accounts."

              <Accordion
                title="How much much does it cost to collect rent using Avail?"
                answer="Landlords pay no fees to collect rent using Avail. The tenant pays the fees depending on the type of payment. If a landlord is on the Unlimited subscription, tenants must pay $2.50 per payment. However, ACH fees are waived for landlords with Unlimited Plus. Payments made with a credit or debit card require a 3.5% convenience fee. Learn more on our Pricing page."

                title="Does Avail provide landlords with 1099 forms?"
                answer="Yes, in compliance with federal regulations, landlords must submit their tax information to collect payments through Avail. This is to comply with the IRS 1099-K requirements and ensure you're issued a 1099-K form. Visit our 1099 frequently asked questions page for more information."

                answer="Yes, Avail allows tenants to report on-time rent payments to TransUnion through CreditBoost. For $3.95/per reported month, tenants can turn on CreditBoost when submitting their payment to have it go towards their FICO 9, FICO XD, and VantageScore credit scores. They can also report up to 24 months of rent to get credit for their previous payments."
